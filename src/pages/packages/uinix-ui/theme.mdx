## Overview

Proper organization of theme definitions in the <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> `theme` construct improves subsequent organization of styles and UI components.  This guide will provide a few basic recipes and patterns when working with the `theme` spec.

## Theme and CSS Properties

Theme properties (i.e. keys of `theme`) relate to CSS properties through a simple `themeMapping` shown below:

<Json value={themeMapping} />

This means that any value defined in a theme property is accessible in the relating CSS properties when assigned a theme value.

## Nesting and Organization

Theme values defined in the `theme` follow a fixed object-based definition.  For each theme property, we can assign arbitrarily nested theme definitions, which eventually resolve to CSS values.

The following example demonstrates defining and accessing the `spacings` theme property with a flat definition.

```js
const theme = {
  spacings: {
    'xs': '4px',
    's': '8px',
    'm': '16px',
    'l': '32px',
    'xl': '64px',
  },
};

const themedStyle = {
  margin: 'xs',
  padding: 'l',
};
```

If you wish to define and access theme values with a hierarchal organization, nesting theme values in theme definitions becomes a useful approach, as shown in the example below.

```js
const theme = {
  sizes: {
    anchor: '12px',
    height: {
      input: '40px',
    },
    icon: {
      s: '16px',
      m: '20px',
      l: '24px',
    },
    width: {
      container: '768px',
    },
  },
};

const themedStyle = {
  height: 'height.input', // access via theme property paths
  width: 'width.container',
};
```

Note that **all** theme properties follow this structure, including the `keyframes` properties.

```js
const theme = {
  animations: {
    infinite: { // nested
      fast: '1s linear infinite',
      default: '2s linear infinite',
      slow: '5s linear infinite',
    },
  },
  keyframes: {
    flicker: { // resolves to a CSS keyframes rule
      '0%': {opacity: '0'},
      '50%': {opacity: '1'},
      '100%': {opacity: '0'},
    },
    spin: {
      default: { // nested
        from: {
          transform: 'rotate(0deg)',
        },
        to: {
          transform: 'rotate(360deg)',
        },
      },
    },
  }
};

const themedStyle = {
  animation: 'infinite.default',
  animationName: 'spin.default', // keyframe name accessed via nested property path
};
```

A consistent pattern for defining theme properties and definitions promotes a reliable and scalable way to maintain the `theme` spec.

## Redundancy is Okay

Sharing code through abstraction is a good way to reduce complexity but this is not always the case.  In some situations, redundancy is preferred to promote more meaningful access patterns.

Say we have the following `colors` spec and components accessing color values,

```js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    brand: {
      primary: '#0366d6',
      secondary: '#808a95',
      light: '#adb4bb',
    },
  },
};

const Brand = () => <Text as="h1" color="brand.primary">uinix-ui</Text>
const Link = (props) => <Text {...props} as="a" color="brand.primary" />
const H1 = (props) => <Text {...props} as="h1" color="brand.secondary" />
```

While we avoided duplication of color values, our subsequent code was authored in a less meaningful way.  Instead, had we favored duplication, our components would have been authored in a more meaningful and semantic way.

```js
const theme = {
  colors: {
    brand: {
      primary: '#0366d6',
      secondary: '#808a95',
      light: '#adb4bb',
    },
    text: {
      link: '#0366d6',
      primary: '#808a95',
    },
  },
};

const Brand = () => <Text as="h1" color="brand.primary">uinix-ui</Text>
const Link = (props) => <Text {...props} as="a" color="text.link" />
const H1 = (props) => <Text {...props} as="h1" color="text.primary" />
```

Note that while the `colors` spec itself has redundancy, the code that generates the spec can be authored in a reusable way.  In general, find a balance between abstraction and intended usage.  There is no golden rule!

## `theme !== styles`

The `theme` only deals with defining theme values.  Unlike [theme-ui]'s `theme`, it does not deal with concepts of styles, variants, typography, color modes etc.  These are deferred to other constructs in <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" />, such as `styles`.  This ensures that the responsibility of `theme` is well-defined and can be used in a simple and consistent way to develop UIs.

## Examples

The following provides common patterns for theme definitions of notable theme properties.  Feel free to adapt and configure them accordingly to your needs.

### `animations`

The following organizes animations based on their `animation-iteration-count` (e.g. `infinite`) and `animation-duration`.  Note that the `animation-name` is not defined, since it is common to use `animations` with [`keyframes`](#keyframes) (with the latter providing theme definitions exactly for the `animation-name` CSS property).

<Json
  value={{
    animations: theme.animations,
  }}
/>

### `borders`

Most UIs should only be using a few border definitions.

<Json
  value={{
    borders: theme.borders,
  }}
/>

### `colors`

Example of [redundant](#redundancy-is-okay) color organization to improve access patterns when using colors.  The following example models color access based on the `background`, `brand`, `text`, `tones` groups.

<Json
  value={{
    colors: theme.colors,
  }}
/>

### `fontFamilies`

Most UIs should only be using a few font family definitions.

<Json
  value={{
    fontFamilies: theme.fontFamilies,
  }}
/>

### `fontSizes`

This example models font sizes as t-shirt sizes.  You may employ a different approach.

<Json
  value={{
    fontSizes: theme.fontSizes,
  }}
/>

### `keyframes`

Keyframes are formally supported in <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" />.  They are related to the `animationName` CSS property as mentioned in [ยง Theme and CSS Properties](#theme-and-css-properties).  The values for `keyframes` should be valid CSS keyframes rules expressed in JS notation.

<Json
  value={{
    keyframes: theme.keyframes,
  }}
/>

### `opacities`

A good way to organize and keep track of a finite set of opacities.

<Json
  value={{
    opacities: theme.opacities,
  }}
/>

### `radii`

A good way to organize and keep track of a finite set of border radii.

<Json
  value={{
    radii: theme.radii,
  }}
/>

### `shadows`

This example models shadows as t-shirt sizes.  You may employ a different approach.

<Json
  value={{
    shadows: theme.shadows,
  }}
/>

### `sizes`

This example tracks sizes in two major groups: `height` and `width`, and also include component/domain groups.

<Json
  value={{
    sizes: theme.sizes,
  }}
/>

### `spacings`

This example models spacings as t-shirt sizes, with some component/domain spacing definitions.  You may employ a different approach.

<Json
  value={{
    spacings: theme.spacings,
  }}
/>

### `transforms`

A good way to organize and keep track of a finite set of transform rules.

<Json
  value={{
    transforms: theme.transforms,
  }}
/>

### `transitions`

A good way to organize and keep track of a finite set of transition rules.

<Json
  value={{
    transitions: theme.transitions,
  }}
/>

### `zIndices`

A good way to organize and keep track of a finite set of zIndices.  This is a good way to compare and make sense of [z-index hell]!

<Json
  value={{
    zIndices: theme.zIndices,
  }}
/>
