# Animations

In this guide, we will learn how to organize and implement CSS animations for <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> components.

> **Notes:**
- This document provides examples written in [React].  The examples can be similarly implemented with any [hyperscript]-based view library.  For further reading, please refer to the <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> package for API documentation.
- This guide contains interactive examples.  Feel free to edit the code!

## Defining animations

Animations and CSS keyframes receive first-class support in <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> (no dependencies and further setup is required).  These are formalized in `system.theme`, providing a convenient way to define and centralize animations in the system.

For more details on how animation theme properties relate with their corresponding CSS properties, please refer to the <PackageLink name="uinix-theme" /> package.


### `system.theme.animations`

Define the [CSS `animation` property][css-animation-property] in `theme.animations`.  You can recursively nest theme definitions as long as they eventually resolve to valid `animation` CSS values.

<Json
  value={{
    theme: {
      animations: theme.animations,
    },
  }}
/>

### `system.theme.keyframes`

Define the [CSS `animation-name` property][css-animation-name-property] in `system.theme.keyframes`.  You can recursively nest theme definitions as long as they eventually resolve to valid [`CSSKeyframesRule`][csskeyframesrule] expressed in JS notation.

<Json
  value={{
    theme: {
      keyframes: theme.keyframes,
    },
  }}
/>

## Using animations

Ensure that your system is `load`ed, then simply reference animations by their theme property paths and define them in the `styles` prop.

```js live scope=ui
<Element
  styles={[
    // edit using valid theme.animations and theme.keyframes property paths
    {animation: 'infinite.slow', animationName: 'flicker'},
    // other styles
    {border: 'bordered', padding: 'm'},
  ]}>
  Animation is simple with uinix-ui.
  It works for any uinix-ui component, like the following icon component:
  <Icon
    icon="up"
    styles={[
      {animation: 'infinite.fast', animationName: 'spin.default'},
    ]}
    w="min-content"
  />
</Element>
```

> **Note:** There is a slight precedence requirement based on how shorthand CSS properties behave.  Since the [`animation`][css-animation-property] shorthand CSS property includes the [`animation-name`][css-animation-name-property] CSS property, you should ensure that the `animationName` key is specified after the `animation` key, to prevent overriding with an empty `animationName`.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned how simple it is to apply animations to <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> components.  In addition, we also learned how <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> formalizes animations and CSS keyframes directly in `system.theme`, providing a centralized way to organize system animations.
