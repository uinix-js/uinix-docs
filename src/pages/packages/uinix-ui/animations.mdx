# Animations

In this guide, we will learn how to organize and implement CSS animations for <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> components.

> **Note:** This document provides examples written in [React].  The examples can be similarly implemented with any [hyperscript]-based view library.  For further reading, please refer to the <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> package for API documentation.

## Defining animations

Animations and CSS keyframes receive first-class support in <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> (no dependencies and further setup is required).  These are formalized in `system.theme`, providing a convenient way to define and centralize animations in the system.

For more details on how animation theme properties relate with their corresponding CSS properties, please refer to the <PackageLink name="uinix-theme" /> package.


### `theme.animations`

Define the [CSS `animation` property][css-animation-property] in `theme.animations`.  You can recursively nest theme definitions as long as they eventually resolve to valid `animation` CSS values.

```js
const theme = {
  animations: {
    infinite: {
      fast: '1s ease-in-out infinite',
      default: '2s ease-in-out infinite',
      slow: '5s ease-in-out infinite',
    },
  },
};
```

### `theme.keyframes`

Define the [CSS `animation-name` property][css-animation-name-property] in `theme.keyframes`.  You can recursively nest theme definitions as long as they eventually resolve to valid [`CSSKeyframesRule`][csskeyframesrule] expressed in JS notation.

```js
const theme = {
  keyframes: {
    flicker: {
      '0%': {opacity: '0'},
      '50%': {opacity: '1'},
      '100%': {opacity: '0'},
    },
    spin: {
      default: { // can be recursively nested and organized
        '100%': {transform: 'rotate(360deg)'},
      },
    },
  },
};
```

## Using animations

Ensure that your system is `load`ed, then simply reference animations by their theme property paths and define them in the `styles` prop.

The example below is interactive so feel free to edit the code!

```js live
() => {
  const animatedStyle = {
    // edit and use a valid theme.animations property path (e.g. "infinite.fast")
    animation: 'infinite.slow',
    // edit and use a valid theme.keyframes property path (e.g. "spin.default")
    animationName: 'flicker',
  };

  const animatedStyle2 = {
    animation: 'infinite.fast',
    animationName: 'spin.default',
  };

  // edit other styles
  const otherStyle = {
    border: 'bordered',
    padding: 'm',
  };

  const styles = [animatedStyle, otherStyle];

  return (
    <Element styles={styles}>
      Animation is simple with uinix-ui.
      It works for any uinix-ui component, like the following icon component:
      <Icon icon="up" styles={animatedStyle2} w="min-content" />
    </Element>
  );
}
```

> **Note:** There is a slight precedence requirement based on how shorthand CSS properties behave.  Since the [`animation`][css-animation-property] shorthand CSS property includes the [`animation-name`][css-animation-name-property] CSS property, you should ensure that the `animationName` key is specified after the `animation` key, to prevent overriding with an empty `animationName`.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we learned how simple it is to apply animations to <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> components.  In addition, we also learned how <PackageLink name="uinix-ui" /> formalizes animations and CSS keyframes directly in `system.theme`, providing a centralized way to organize system animations.
